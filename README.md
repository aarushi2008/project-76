the app is basically going to have a login page where we have to login , sign in and sign up to use the app , once we login we should not do it again and again . 
there are going to be 2 screens 
first screen is the giving screen
second screen is the taking screen
in the first screen(giving screen) we will have to write a thing which we need and why
in the sceond screen(taking screen) we need to respond to the request of the person who asked our for a thing and write a response whether we want to give the item to the person or not and then the person who is asking a thing will get notifided that whether his / her request is read or not
besides that we are going to have a setting screen in which the user can update there profile if they want to change there address , phone number , name or email
then we will have a button by which we can thank the person who sent us the thing a small thank you note to show our thanking attitude towards them
